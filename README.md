# Sketch Pad

This is a simple sketch pad built using Javascript and the jQuery library. You can shade in squares of the pad using your mouse, and you can also reconfigure the pad's resolution.

## Installation

This is a web-based project, so no installation is necessary. But to experiment with your own copy of the code, you can use the following:

`git clone git@github.com:adc17/sketch-pad.git`

## Usage

If you want to try out my finished project online, it is hosted [here](https://adc17.github.io/sketch-pad/) on github.io.

## Further Information

This was my first real Javascript project, and though I tried my best, I doubt I've used good practice! I wrote it while following [the Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com), a free online web development curriculum.
